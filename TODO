TODO
====

- Rename SMPPCommunicator to SmppChannel.
- Avoid SmppChannel from inheriting from Component, as it has no design-time enhancements.
- Create a fully Synchronous SmppSession API.
- Review concurrency issues..
- Change ReBindTimer by a AutoResetEvent which also allows checking periodically 
  if we need to reconnect, but which can be signalled explicitly to try to reconnect now.
- Change EnquireLinkTimer & ReBindTimer to AutoReset=false, so we avoid events from queuing 
  when handler take too long to finish.
