10/11/2008 : License changed to GNU Lesser General Public License, V3.  This should make combination with other (older) open source licenses such as the original BSD license possible.

11/13/2006 : Added the remainder of the code to the project; I will no longer be working on this app.

08/13/2005 : I've replaced much of the older code with new (hopefully more useful) code.  This 
new set of namespaces includes both incoming and outgoing functionality for all the PDUs.  Note also 
that this release is GPL only-I have dropped the QPL portion of the license from here on out. I 
also fixed the dates on this changelog-for some reason I had them a year off.

08/20/2004 : Host of changes.  The PDUFactory and several incoming PDUs were changed
for compatibility after some testing.  Added some documentation tags.  Fixed TLVTable 
so that null tags are simply dropped (i.e. trying to set an optional param to null 
does nothing).  Also added the debug file and xml file to the binary release.  Also
changed the zip files so that they store relative path info rather than full path info
(to those of you who downloaded the early release-sorry about that).

08/15/2004 : Changed the PDUFactory so that it allows multiple responses to come in on
a PDU.  Also fixed the TrimResponsePDU() so that it didn't break if the command length 
was too large (the null SMSC I was testing with today sent some out like that.  Also 
included a build script.

08/14/2004 : Initial release.
